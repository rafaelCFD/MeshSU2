# MeshSU2
Create a mesh of a airfoil

Run the file mainSU2 in python 3

Input data:

N  = 101        # Airfoil number of points

M  = 50        # 20

c  = 1.        # Chord [m]

m  = 2.        # Is the maximum camber (100 m is the first of the four digits),

p  = 5.        # Is the location of maximum camber (10 p is the second digit in the NACA xxxx description).

t  = 12.       # Is the maximum thickness as a fraction of the chord 
                # (so t gives the last two digits in the NACA 4-digit denomination divided by 100)
